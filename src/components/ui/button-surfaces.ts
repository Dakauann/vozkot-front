/**
 * What a button LOOKS like, declared once.
 *
 * Two button components ship in this app and both are load-bearing:
 * `elevated-design/button` is the one people reach for (129 files), and
 * `ui/button` exports `buttonVariants` as a class-string function, which the
 * shadcn primitives (alert-dialog, pagination, confirm-dialog) need because
 * they style their own elements rather than render a component.
 *
 * That is a fair reason for two components. It was never a reason for two
 * copies of the class strings, which is what they had: `primary`, `secondary`
 * and `ghost` were character-identical in both files, and `outline` was
 * identical right up until it wasn't — it went a half pixel heavier than every
 * field on the screen and nobody noticed for as long as the two were only ever
 * read one at a time.
 *
 * Both components import these. A change here reaches every button in the app,
 * which is the point.

 * the fields' 1px reads as a heavier corner arc and a different control at the

 *
 * Dropping to 1px does not weaken the boundary. The 3:1 comes from
 * --control-edge, the token that fixed the invisible 1.79:1 (light) / 1.36:1
 * (dark) edge this replaced; the extra half pixel was never carrying it, and
 * every field on the screen proves 1px on this token is enough.
